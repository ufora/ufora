*Known Issues:

* `def` order is important in non-module function definition (closures). If functions
  `g()` and `h()` are defined inside of function `f` and `g()` calls `h()`, then `def h():` must
  appear BEFORE `def g():`.
  This also implies that mutually-recursive functions are only possible at module or class level.

* Class static methods cannot be used as values. They can be invoked, but it's not possible
  to pass a class static method as an argument to another function.

* Named argument calls are not supported. If you have a function `def f(x):...` you can call it as
  `f(42)` but you can't use `f(x=42)`.

* Keyword arguments are not supported.

* Class members can only be initialized inside of `__init__`. If `__init__` calls another function
  that initializes members, those members will not be seen by pyfora.

* `return` statements not allowed in `__init__()`

* @classmethod decorator is not supported.

* No support for `*args`.

* `assert` is not implemented.

* Bad error message when using `self` inside of `__init__` for things other than setting or getting
  members. For example, calling `str(self)` inside of `__init__` results in
  "PythonToForaConversionError: An internal error occurred: we didn't provide a definition for the following variables: ['self'].
    Most likely, there is a mismatch between our analysis of the python code and the generated FORA code underneath. Please file a bug report."

* No support for object inheritance.
